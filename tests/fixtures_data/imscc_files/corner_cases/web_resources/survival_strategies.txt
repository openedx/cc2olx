Wild animals have developed various survival strategies to avoid predators, enhancing their chances of survival.
Camouflage is one of the most effective methods, where animals blend into their surroundings to remain unseen.
Some species rely on speed and agility to escape danger, such as gazelles outrunning lions.
Others use defensive behaviors, like the porcupine’s sharp quills or the skunk’s foul spray, to deter predators.
Mimicry is also common, with animals like stick insects resembling branches to deceive attackers.
Additionally, some creatures form large groups or herds, confusing predators through sheer numbers or collective defense tactics.
These survival techniques are essential for maintaining balance in the wild ecosystem.
